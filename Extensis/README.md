# Connect Fonts EOL?
The [URL](http://bin.extensis.com/sf-26.0.5-m-all.dmg) to download Connect Fonts 26.0.5 is now failing. I think it's been EOL'd and Extensis Connect is the main product, but I'm waiting on Extensis to confirm.

Using https://sparkle.extensis.com/u/ST/EN/suitcase25en.xml to download.
I think this changes when version changes.

SparkleFeed has two DMG links, both same version, for two different applications.
